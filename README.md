# It's A Hardback Life Book Club App

## Overview
It’s A Hardback Life is a moderately sized book club wanting to switch over from mail correspondence / phone calls to a digital platform to better keep track of the books read / members’ information, as well as reach out to more potential club members. They currently have 100 club members, and read about 20 - 30 books from the booklist each year. Club members can belong to multiple different discussion groups (e.g. mystery books, Jane Austen books, etc.).

The database will solve the problem of keeping track of which books each club member / group is reading, since with the expansion of the book club there were problems of duplications / general errors in record keeping by hand.
